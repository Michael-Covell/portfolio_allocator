# portfolio_allocator

Calculate the optimal allotments of a lump sum to investments in a portfolio with a target allocation.  This may be used as an alternative to rebalancing.

## Description

portfolio_allocator is a user-defined function written in python.  It's purpose is to determine the best allocation of a lump sum to a portfolio.  Given a lump sum of cash and a set of target percentages, it calculates allotments that will render a portfolio matching a target allocation as closely as possible.  Depending on the allotment method, allotments are calculated based on the discrepancy between each investmentâ€™s current and target values (i.e., deficits) or the difference between current and target percentages (i.e., allocation error).  The allocate_by_rank method calculates allotments iteratively by allocating cash to eliminate the deficits in rank order until the cash is gone.  For example, if the cash is $3 and the two top ranking deficits are each $2, this method will result in an allocation of $2 to the top-ranking deficit and $1 to the subsequent deficit.  In contrast, the allocate_for_minimal_errors method minimizes allocation errors across investments as much as possible.  

An Apps Script file containing a custom function has been added to this repository to offer a Google Sheets implementation of the allocate_for_minimal_errors method.
