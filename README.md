# portfolio_allocator

Optimize the distribution of funds to a portfolio of investments or budgetary funding recipients according to a corresponding set of target allocations.

## Description

portfolio_allocator is a user-defined function written in python.  Given a set of target allocations, current values of investments, and a cash value provided by the user, portfolio_allocator generates an allotment for each investment.  Allotment sets are calculated based on the discrepancy between each investmentâ€™s current and target values (i.e., deficits) or the difference between current and target allocations (i.e., error).  The allocate_by_rank method allocates cash to eliminate the deficits in rank order until the cash is gone.  For example, if the cash is $3 and the two top ranking deficits are each $2, this method will result in an allocation of $2 to the top-ranking deficit and $1 to the subsequent deficit. The allocate_for_minimal_errors method is designed to minimize errors as much as possible.  For a more detailed description of portfolio_allocator, its purposes, and functional components, please see the accompanying file, purpose_and_uses.md.  An illustration of how each method works is provided by the supplementary notebook included in this repository.
