# portfolio_allocator

Calculate the optimal allotments of a lump sum to investments in a portfolio with a target allocation.  This may be used as an alternative to rebalancing.

## Description

portfolio_allocator is a user-defined function written in python.  Given a lump sum of cash, it calculates the allotments that will render a portfolio matching a target allocation as closely as possible.  Allotments are calculated based on the discrepancy between each investmentâ€™s current and target values (i.e., deficits) or the difference between current and target allocations (i.e., allocation error).  The allocate_by_rank method calculates allotments iteratively by allocating cash to eliminate the deficits in rank order until the cash is gone.  For example, if the cash is $3 and the two top ranking deficits are each $2, this method will result in an allocation of $2 to the top-ranking deficit and $1 to the subsequent deficit. In contrast, the allocate_for_minimal_errors method minimizes allocation error as much as possible.  For a more detailed description of portfolio_allocator, its purposes, and functional components, please see the accompanying file, purpose_and_uses.md.  An guided tour of how each method works is provided by the supplementary ipynb notebook included in this repository.
